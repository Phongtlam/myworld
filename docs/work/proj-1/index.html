<p><a href="https://deep-subs.herokuapp.com/"><strong>React-Chess</strong></a> was born from the love of the game. This is going to be under constant development as I learn to optimize the AI, get better at the game and just build beautiful UI. If you have the love for chess or programming in general, I&rsquo;d love to chat!</p>
